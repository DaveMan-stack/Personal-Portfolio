                    <p style="--para:2; --l:I" class="first-letter relative max-w-lg">Initially, like any other kid, David was just using his computer to watch movies on YouTube and play video games. However, one day while browsing through YouTube, he stumbled upon a video of a twelve-year-old boy who had mastered two programming languages and was creating apps. This was the turning point for David, and he became intrigued by the idea of coding.
